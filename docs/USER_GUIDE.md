- **Smooth animations**: Transitions are smooth and engaging
- **Responsive design**: Adapts to your screen size
- **Performance optimized**: Maintains smooth 60fps on most devices

### Troubleshooting 3D Issues

If the 3D visualization isn't working:

1. **Check WebGL support**: Visit https://get.webgl.org/
2. **Update your browser** to the latest version
3. **Enable hardware acceleration** in browser settings
4. **Close other tabs** to free up resources
5. **The app includes a 2D fallback** that activates automatically

## Advanced Features

1. **Manual backup**: Copy task text to another document
2. **Browser sync**: Use browser sync features if available
3. **Multiple devices**: Tasks don't sync between devices

## Tips for Productivity

### Effective Task Management
