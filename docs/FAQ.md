# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What is the 3D Todo App?

The 3D Todo App is a modern task management application that combines practical productivity features with engaging 3D visualizations. It allows you to create, manage, and track tasks while providing visual feedback through a dynamic 3D component that represents your completion progress.

### Do I need to create an account to use the app?

No, the app works without any registration, login, or account creation. You can start using it immediately when you open it in your browser.

### Is the app free to use?

Yes, the 3D Todo App is completely free and open-source. There are no premium features, subscriptions, or hidden costs.

### Where is my data stored?

All your tasks are stored locally in your browser's localStorage. No data is sent to external servers, ensuring complete privacy and offline functionality.

## Privacy and Security

### Is my data private?

Yes, absolutely. Your tasks and all data remain on your device and are never transmitted to any external servers. The app works entirely client-side for maximum privacy.

### Can others see my tasks?

No, your tasks are stored locally on your device and are not accessible to anyone else unless they have physical access to your device and browser.

### Does the app track my usage?

No, the app does not include any analytics, tracking, or data collection. Your usage patterns and task data remain completely private.

### Is it safe to use at work?

Yes, since no data leaves your device, it's safe to use for work-related tasks. However, always follow your organization's policies regarding software usage.

## Technical Questions

### What browsers are supported?

The app works on modern browsers that support:
- ES2020+ JavaScript features
- WebGL (for 3D visualization)
- localStorage API

Supported browsers include:
- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

### Why isn't the 3D visualization working?

The most common reasons are:
1. **WebGL not supported**: Check at https://get.webgl.org/
2. **Hardware acceleration disabled**: Enable it in browser settings
3. **Outdated browser**: Update to the latest version
4. **Graphics driver issues**: Update your graphics drivers

The app includes a 2D fallback that should activate automatically if 3D isn't available.

### Can I use the app offline?

Yes, after the initial load, the app works completely offline. Your tasks are stored locally and don't require an internet connection.

### What happens if I clear my browser data?

Clearing browser data will delete all your tasks since they're stored in localStorage. Make sure to manually backup important tasks before clearing browser data.

### How much data can I store?

localStorage typically allows 5-10MB of data, which can store thousands of tasks. The app will handle storage limits gracefully.

## Features and Functionality

### Can I organize tasks into categories or projects?

The current version focuses on simplicity with a single task list. Categories and project organization are planned for future versions.

### Can I set due dates or reminders?

Not in the current version. The app is designed for simple, immediate task tracking without complex scheduling features.

### Can I share my task list with others?

Currently, tasks are private and stored locally, so sharing isn't supported. Collaboration features may be added in future versions.

### Can I sync tasks between devices?

No, tasks are stored locally on each device. Cloud synchronization is not currently available but may be added as an optional feature in the future.

### Can I export or backup my tasks?

The current version doesn't include built-in export functionality. You can manually copy task text for backup purposes. Export features are planned for future versions.

### How do I delete all tasks at once?

Currently, you need to delete tasks individually. Bulk operations are planned for future versions. As a workaround, you can clear localStorage in browser developer tools.

## Performance and Optimization

### Why is the app running slowly?

Common causes and solutions:
1. **Too many browser tabs**: Close unnecessary tabs
2. **Outdated browser**: Update to the latest version
3. **Hardware limitations**: The app automatically adjusts quality
4. **Background applications**: Close resource-intensive programs

### How can I improve 3D performance?

1. **Enable hardware acceleration** in browser settings
2. **Update graphics drivers**
3. **Close other tabs and applications**
4. **Use a desktop browser** (generally better performance than mobile)

### What's the target frame rate for 3D animations?

The app targets 60fps for smooth animations but will automatically adjust quality to maintain at least 30fps on lower-end devices.

### Does the app work well on mobile?

Yes, the app is fully optimized for mobile devices with:
- Touch-friendly interface
- Responsive design
- Automatic performance optimization
- Mobile-specific interactions

## Troubleshooting

### My tasks disappeared. How can I recover them?

If tasks disappeared:
1. **Refresh the page** - temporary loading issue
2. **Check if localStorage is enabled** in browser settings
3. **Verify you're using the same browser and profile**
4. **Check if browser data was cleared**

Unfortunately, if localStorage data is lost, tasks cannot be recovered.

### The app won't load or shows errors

Try these steps:
1. **Refresh the page** (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Clear browser cache** for the site
3. **Try a different browser**
4. **Check browser console** for specific error messages
5. **Disable browser extensions** temporarily

### Tasks aren't saving

Check if:
1. **localStorage is enabled** in browser settings
2. **You're not in private/incognito mode**
3. **Storage quota isn't exceeded**
4. **Browser has sufficient permissions**
